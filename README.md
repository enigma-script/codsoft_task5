CODSOFT Data Science Internship – Task 5 
💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳 

📌 Project Overview  
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions on a highly imbalanced real-world dataset (~0.17% fraud).

🚀 Objectives  
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE  
- Feature scaling  
- Train classification models (Random Forest)  
- Evaluate with Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC  
- Interactive Streamlit web app for predictions

📊 Dataset 
- Anonymized credit card transactions  
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data

⚙️ Technologies  
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, Streamlit

🧠 Pipeline  
1. Load & explore data  
2. Scale features  
3. SMOTE oversampling  
4. Train Random Forest  
5. Evaluate metrics  
6. Streamlit live prediction

📈 Results  
High recall on fraud class after balancing, interactive demo.

▶️ How to Run 
#```bash

cd codsoft_task5

pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py
